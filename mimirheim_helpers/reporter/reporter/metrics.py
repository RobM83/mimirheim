"""Shared energy and economic metrics for mimirheim-reporter.

This module is the single source of truth for all quantitative computations
derived from a solved schedule or a SolveResult output dict. It is a
pure-function library with no I/O or external dependencies beyond the Python
standard library.

What this module does:
    - Compute grid exchange, PV generation, load consumption, self-consumption,
      and self-sufficiency from a raw schedule list.
    - Compute economic performance indicators (naive cost, optimised cost, SOC
      credit, effective cost, saving) from a SolveResult output dict.
    - Compute a representative average efficiency from a device segment or
      piecewise-linear curve model.
    - Split a hybrid inverter's AC exchange into its solar and battery parts.

What this module does not do:
    - Read or write files.
    - Publish MQTT messages.
    - Render HTML or Plotly figures.
    - Import from ``mimirheim`` or any other reporter submodule.
